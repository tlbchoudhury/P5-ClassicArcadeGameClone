To play the Arcade Frogger game:
the "up" arrow allows the player to move up
the "down" arrow allows the player to move down
the "right" arrow allows the player to move right
the "left" arrow allows the player to move left

To complete the game successfully the player must get to the water (top row) without colliding with the enemy.
Once collision happens the player will move back to initial location. Once player successfully reaches the water the game will reset & the player will move to the initial location.
